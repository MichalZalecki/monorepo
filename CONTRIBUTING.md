# Contributing

All contributions to `codechecks` are welcomed.

We coordinate our efforts using GitHub issues so make sure that before you start working on a new feature you submit a
corresponding issue.

When you're done with your changes use `yarn test:fix`. This will reformat your code using `prettier`, try autofixing
linter error and will run `tsc` and finally tests.

Thanks! 🙏🏻
